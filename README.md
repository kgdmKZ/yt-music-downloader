# YouTube MP3 Downloader

This application lets you automate the process of searching for YouTube videos, downloading them, and extracting MP3s. 

If you don't run the source file directly using the Python interpreter, self-contained executables that work for Linux and Windows are included.

Upon opening the app, you are presented with this screen: <br />

Enter a video search query in the first text box. Add text boxes by pressing enter or using the first button.

When you are finished, you can press the middle button to download MP3s of the audio for each first search result.

If you would prefer more choice over which result is downloaded, use the last button. On the next screen, you will be able to navigate through each set of results and make a choice for each. When you've made a choice for each one, the downloads will begin.
